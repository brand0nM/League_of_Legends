# Pyeague_of_Legends
## Overview
Using Riot's Developer API's I'm trying to create a game statistics Dashboard to analyse my performance; Additionally, I want to create an in-game overlay that can track cs and kda.
### Purpose
Rest API's will allow us to query data from Riot about League of Legend based on region or summoner name.
