## Summary
We successfully queried the API and stored its results in JSON directories.

### Further Improvements
Using javascript or react it would be relatively easy to create an interactive dashboard as opposed to an interactive notebook; this would also allow linking between directories, making images visible; We can link the characters JSON data (can be scraped or downloaded) to give champion names.
